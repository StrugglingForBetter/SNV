SNV
====

### Introduction

SNV is an open source MATLAB/C++ implementation of the super normal vector (SNV) for human activity recognition using depth sequences.


### Dependency

The code depends on [SPAMS](http://spams-devel.gforge.inria.fr/downloads.html) and [LIBLINEAR](http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear/) libraries that are enclosed in the package. If they are not compatible with your platform, please download and setup accordingly. 


### Bugs and Extensions

If you find any bug or develop some extensions, please feel free to drop me a line.
